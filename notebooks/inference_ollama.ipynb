Between the years 1964 and 1973, 225 patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) due primarily to atherosclerosis were evaluated and treated. They have now been followed for from 3 to 14 years (average 5.5 years). As of 1976, 82 of the 225 patients were dead, 21 from cerebral infarction, 52 from heart disease and nine from other causes. Of the 56 untreated patients, 11 (19 percent) had cerebral infarctions, four (7 percent) of which were fatal; six (11 percent) were still having TIAs. Of the 45 patients medically treated, 10 (24 percent) had cerebral infarctions, three (7 percent) of which were fatal; 11(25 percent) still experienced TIAs. In the surgical group of 124, 27 (21 percent) had postoperative cerebral infarctions, seven (6 percent) of which were fatal; 23 (18 percent) had cerebral infarctions during follow-up, of which seven (6 percent) were fatal; and 15 (12 percent) were still having TIAs. No statistically significant differences (p less than 0.05) related to cerebral infarction or TIAs developed among the three groups. The majority (23 percent) eventually succumbed to myocardial infarction, leading us to conclude that great emphasis must be placed upon TIAs as a warning for cardiac as well as cerebrovascular disease.'),\n",

THE purpose of this study was to determine the difference in prognosis among patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIA) in the carotid arterial system and those with TIA in the vertebral-basilar arterial system. Nearly twice as many patients had TIA in the carotid system as had TIA in the vertebral-basilar system. The survival rates for patients with carotid TIA and those with vertebral-basilar TIA were similar. In both groups, the survival rate was lower than the expected survival rate, but only for the patients with carotid TIA was the difference significant. There was no significant difference in the probability of the occurrence of stroke between patients with carotid TIA and those with vertebral-basilar TIA. These data also indicate that the risk of stroke is much greater soon after the onset of TIA in either arterial system. Among all patients with TIA, the primary cause of death was cardiac disease. The causes of death had a similar distribution for patients with carotid TIA, for those with vertebral-basilar TIA, and for those with \"mixed\" or \"unknown\" types of TIA.'),\n",

Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are the most reliable warning sign of impending stroke and are highly indicative of significant coronary artery disease.

Diagnostic testing is individualized but often includes ECG and cerebral contrast angiography. Exercise testing, echocardiography, ultrasound, CT, and/or MRI are sometimes indicated.

The knowledge obtained from the ongoing investigational trials of tPA for acute ischemic stroke will not only help establish the appropriate dose range and complication rates but will also further develop the clearly mandatory rapid, aggressive team approach needed to truly treat acute ischemic strokes successfully. Experimental cerebral ischemia data have pointed to the need to treat acute clinical stroke within only a few hours or less to effectively reduce stroke morbidity and mortality. Specifically, with reversible MCA occlusion models of focal cerebral ischemia (dogs and cats), the animals uniformly survive without neurological deficit if the occlusion is for less than 2 to 3 hours. Similarly in primates, MCA occlusion for 3 hours or less will lead to clinical improvement and a decrease in infarct size, with complete recovery generally associated with less than 2 hours of MCA occlusion. Therefore, it appears unlikely that ischemic brain can be salvaged if vascular occlusion persists longer than 4 to 6 hours (similar to the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia). Further, at least one third of ischemic stroke patients reperfuse spontaneously (and obviously too late) within 48 hours of stroke onset. Several factors believed to be related to successful outcome after thrombolytic therapy are summarized in Table 16. A schematic approach to determining the response to thrombolytic agents in acute ischemic stroke is outlined in Table 17. Zivin succinctly reviews thrombolysis for stroke, both experimental and clinical, and summarizes some of the difficulties of the early clinical stroke trials with thrombolytic agents and speculates about future prospects. He believes tPA may prove valuable in the treatment of some forms of thromboembolic stroke. Its usefulness may depend in part on how quickly the drug can be initiated and the risk of side effects; factors that will require further study. The currently used doses of tPA may be too low to lyse large cerebral arterial clots and, therefore, if current trials do not show a positive treatment response, further trials with higher doses may be indicated. The implications of a potentially effective treatment for truly acute stroke are enormous: stroke will need to be considered by all (lay public through to caregivers) as a true medical emergency, analogous to MI and trauma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)'),\n",

Five basic views are exposed.
