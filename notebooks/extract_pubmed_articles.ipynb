       "  'Conclusions',\n",
       "  'Our finding suggests that when diagnosing rashes that occur in the diaper area, general pediatricians should consider, in addition to IDD, the possibility of less-common conditions. The simultaneous presence of cutaneous lesions at other sites was linked to diagnoses of systemic diseases other than IDD, (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001).',\n",
       "  'Background',\n",
       "  'Rashes around the diaper area are common in the pediatric population, especially among those who are diaper dependent. The majority of rashes in the diaper area turn out to be irritant diaper dermatitis (IDD), meaning that they are caused by irritation from urine and feces, which is aggravated by wearing diapers. This type of skin inflammation is mostly found in diaper-dependent children under 24\\u2009months of age. Although IDD is the most common diagnosis in cases of inflammation in the diaper area, there are some less common but sometimes serious cutaneous eruptions associated with systemic diseases that should not be discounted. Coughlin el al. classified skin conditions that present in the diaper area in to three groups: 1) skin conditions caused by the presence of the diaper, 2) rashes exacerbated by the diaper (but not directly caused by it), and 3) eruptions present regardless of the presence of the diaper. Previous reviews have indicated a variety of differential diagnoses of cutaneous eruptions in the diaper area. However, there are no statistical data available regarding the frequencies of various types of cutaneous eruptions in the genitoanal area. We thus attempted to ascertain such data using a prospective descriptive study design. Our aim was to promote recognition of some less common diseases in the diaper area in order to prevent misdiagnosis and to identify cutaneous clues indicating systemic diseases that are likely to be misdiagnosed as IDD.',\n",

However, the opposite was true in participants aged over 24\\u2009months (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001: Fig.\\xa01), which is likely explained by the fact that children under 24\\u2009months of age are more likely to be diaper dependent. We also found significant differences between these two groups in terms of rashes exacerbated by the diaper and eruptions present regardless of the presence of the diaper (Fig.\\xa02). This suggests that non-diaper -related rashes can be present even in diaper-dependent patients. Thus, the differential diagnosis of diaper-independent diseases should be considered in patients not using a diaper. ',\n",

This finding suggests that when rashes occur in the diaper area, general pediatricians should consider less -common rashes as differential diagnoses. In one case in our study, the patient was initially diagnosed with IDD before a visit to a dermatology clinic, at which the condition was diagnosed as an ulcerated hemangioma (Fig.\\xa03a). The first manifestation of the condition was a shallow abrasion, which appeared to be an erosive lesion caused by the moisture and heat that results from diaper use. The patient was thus treated for IDD for 1 month without improvement. However, there was noticeable improvement 1 month after a pediatric dermatologist prescribed oral propranolol as treatment for infantile hemangioma in combination with local wound care (Fig. 3b).

Dermatophytosis is a common fungal infection refers to a set of cutaneous diseases divided to eight groups based on the anatomical sites of the body and cause by species from three genera including Trichophyton, Epidermophyton and Microsporum. Other common superficial fungal infections of skin folds can be classified as candidiasis and tinea versicolor which are due to Candida species and Malassezia species, respectively.',\n",

There are various skin disorders affecting the intertriginous areas which resemble in clinical appearances. Though, it is of importance to distinguish among various etiologies. Direct examination and culture are confirmatory tests for diagnosis of fungal skin infections which usually are overlooked in clinical practice and diagnosis are mainly based on the clinical manifestations. Therefore, application of these tests for accurate identification of intertriginous infections could provide valuable epidemiologic data.

       "  'Primary atopic disorders (PAD) are monogenic disorders caused by pathogenic gene variants encoding proteins that are key for the maintenance of a healthy skin barrier and a well-functioning immune system. Physicians face the challenge to find single, extremely rare PAD patients/families among the millions of individuals with common allergic diseases. We describe case scenarios with signature PAD. We review the literature and deduct specific clinical red flags for PAD detection. They include a positive family history and/or signs of pathological susceptibility to infections, immunodysregulation, or syndromic disease. Results of conventional laboratory and most immunological lab studies are not sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis of PAD. In the past, multistep narrowing of differential diagnoses by various immunological and other laboratory tests led to testing of single genes or gene panel analyses, which was a time-consuming and often unsuccessful approach. The implementation of whole-genomic analyses in the routine diagnostics has led to a paradigm shift. Upfront genome-wide analysis by whole genome sequencing (WGS) will shorten the time to diagnosis, save patients from unnecessary investigations, and reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose a rational, clinical landmark-based approach for deciding which cases pass the filter for carrying out early WGS. WGS result interpretation requires a great deal of caution regarding the causal relationship of variants in PAD phenotypes and absence of proof by adequate functional tests. In case of negative WGS results, a re-iteration attitude with re-analyses of the data (using the latest data base annotation)) may eventually lead to PAD diagnosis. PAD, like many other rare genetic diseases, will only be successfully managed, if physicians from different clinical specialties and geneticists interact regularly in multidisciplinary conferences.

       "  'Atopy (from Greek “strangeness”) is defined as “a personal, and/or familial tendency to produce IgE antibodies in response to ordinary exposure to allergens, usually proteins.” Allergies manifest via the interaction of environmental factors (e.g., diet, microbes, pollution, etc.) and host immunity. Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are > 500 disorders in which parts of the immune system are missing, defective or dysfunctional due to monogenic germline variants that result in loss of function (LOF), gain of function (GOF), or multimorphic altered function of the encoded protein. The term PAD refers to a subgroup of IEI with a phenotype that includes allergic diseases as well as genetic disorders of the skin barrier. ',\n",
       "  'Allergic diseases are extremely common (estimated to affect up to 20\\xa0–\\xa030% of the world’s population), while PAD are extremely rare. Therefore, this makes the timely detection of PAD individuals in the large sea of allergic individuals a big challenge. A delay in the diagnosis of PAD is associated with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. Additionally, for affected patients and families, the diagnostic odysseys across many specialties with frequent, sometimes quite invasive investigations, is a huge burden. Therefore, we propose a strategy to identify PAD more rapidly and reliably to reduce morbidity and mortality for the affected individuals. ',\n",

Most diagnostic laboratories today offer the so-called short-read NGS technique, in which patient DNA segments (short reads) of around 150 base pairs are compared with a reference sequence of the human genome (“alignment”). While they cover large regions or even the entire genome rather precisely, all short-read-based HTS techniques have the disadvantage that, methodologically, they cannot reliably resolve certain genomic regions, e.g., repeat expansions or larger homologous genomic regions. For addressing these questions, long-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) might be suitable. Advantages and disadvantages of different HTS assays are summarized in Supplemental Table\\xa01. ',\n",

In the past, the use of these less efficient approaches has led to a loss of precious time. WGS allows more reliable detection of CNV and SV and re-iterative data analysis at later time points. This has the potential of eventually finding the diagnosis, e.g., in a third or fourth interpretation cycle. Finally, identification of novel genes is not unlikely as it is estimated that there are many more PAD waiting to be unraveled by the help of WGS. ',\n",

Genetic analysis is at great danger of over-interpretation (candidate variants identified; incorrect association with phenotype without functional proof) or under-interpretation of data (no candidate variants identified; premature exclusion of PAD). In order to designate pathogenicity to a specific variant, the American College Of Medical Genetics And Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) developed guidance that provides a framework for sequence variant interpretation by utilizing common types of variant evidence, such as population data, computational data, functional data, and segregation data. Variants are classified into benign and likely benign variants (class 1 or 2; likelihood >\\xa099.9 or >\\xa090% of being not pathogenic), variants of unknown significance (VUS) (class 3, likelihood between 10 and 90% of being pathogenic), likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants (class 4 or 5 variants, likelihood of >\\xa090 to 99% or >\\xa099% to be pathogenic).

Variants can be hypermorphic GOF or they can be both (multimorphic). In patients from highly consanguineous families, PAD phenotype might be the result of not only one single, but several variants. In many genetic diseases, there is highly variable expressivity or incomplete penetrance of diseases. Trio (index and parent) and segregation analysis can be helpful and improve the diagnostic yield.

Conventional physical examination by the physician will soon be aided by next genertion phenotyping (NGP) using artificial intelligence (AI) like the GestaltMatcher data base (GMDB). In pilot studies, GMDB has been shown to diagnose syndromic IEI in a reliable manner (unpublished data). However, analyzing and predicting the effect of a VUS on the protein level still remains a challenge. The functional validation of VUS will be sped up by data sharing on platforms (like GeneMatcher) and other publicly accessible online resources and the use of AI.

SCF is the primary growth factor for mast cells, KIT, the cognate receptor for SCF. EGF-like module-containing mucin-like hormone receptor-like 2 (EMR2) is encoded by ADGRE2. Attachment to the membrane is mediated by a noncovalently bound subunit of the receptor, which activates EMR2/ADGRE2 in mast cells, when forcefully dissociated by physical shearing forces/mechanical stress (vibration), leading to degranulation. Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) is important for B-cell differentiation and function. In mast cells, PLCγ2 is downstream of the IgE receptor and catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate to the secondary messengers inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 induces the release of Ca2+ from the ER. PLCγ2 can be activated by cold temperature, which leads to spontaneous calcium flux and degranulation.

The thymic selection of T cells during the first decade of life produces millions of antigenically distinct T cells carrying a very diverse T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire prepared to encounter millions of variants of microbial and other antigens.

The patient presented with severe autoimmune enteropathy and growth charts showing failure to thrive, length and weight <\\xa03rd percentile (right panel, below). Tregs induce peripheral tolerance, preventing development of autoimmune and allergic diseases. Their expression of the high affinity trimeric α/β/γ IL2 receptor (IL2R) helps them to selectively bind IL2 and draw it away from T effector cells (Teff) expressing only the low moderate affinity (β/γ) IL2R. FOXP3 is the lineage defining transcription factor for the development of Tregs. High levels of FOXP3 expression are directly linked to the suppressive capacity of Tregs. FOXP3 expression leads to the upregulation of the high affinity IL2 receptor as well as CTLA-4 on Tregs. CTLA-4 competes with the co-stimulatory molecule, CD28, for binding to CD80 and CD86 on antigen presenting cells (APCs). This is one other mechanism by which Tregs suppress immune responses.

B: JAK1/STAT5/ TGFβ/STAT6 Physiology. TGFβ has roles in immune tolerance, cell cycle arrest, and wound healing. TGFβ signals through TGFBR1 and 2 Receptor. TGFβ increases IL4Rα expression and leads to T helper type 2 (TH2) differentiation and IgE production. ERBIN is a negative regulator of transforming growth factor (TGF)-signaling through interaction with SMAD proteins. STAT3 induces and then forms a complex with ERBIN. STAT5 is activated by signaling through receptors for various cytokines including IL2, hematopoietic growth factors, as well as growth hormone. STAT5B is an important regulator of FOXP3 expression, the essential TF for Tregs. STAT6 signaling induces activation of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), differentiation of TH2 cells from naïve CD4+ T cells and induction of T follicular helper (TFH) cells, which are crucial for B-cell affinity maturation and immunoglobulin class-switch recombination (CSR) in the germinal center.

       "  'All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is an indispensable part of the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Although, mild cutaneous toxicities like mucocutaneous xerosis, rash, and pruritus are well reported, ATRA associated severe dermatological toxicities are extremely rare. ATRA is primary metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system, and triazole antifungals are notorious for their strong inhibitory effect on CYP450.',\n",
       "  'Case presentation',\n",
       "  'Three Asian APL patients experienced rare ATRA-induced severe dermatological toxicities: exfoliative dermatitis (ED) in cases 1 and 2, and necrotic scrotal ulceration in case 3. Both case 1 (33-year-old female), and case 2 (28-year-old male) landed in emergency department with dehydration, generalized skin erythema and xerosis during their induction chemotherapy. Both of these patients also developed invasive aspergillosis and required concomitant triazole antifungals during their chemotherapy. For ED, intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started along with application of local emollients to prevent transdermal water loss. Although their general condition improved but skin exfoliation continued with complete desquamation of palms and soles. Dermatology was consulted, and clinical diagnosis of ED was established. Discontinuation of ATRA resulted in complete resolution of ED. Case 3 (15-year-old boy) reported two blackish mildly tender scrotal lesions during induction chemotherapy. He also had mucocutaneous candidiasis at presentation and was kept on triazole antifungal. Local bacterial & fungal cultures, and serological testing for herpes simplex virus were reported negative. Despite adequate local care and optimal antibiotic support, his lesions persisted, and improved only after temporary discontinuation of ATRA. After a thorough literature review and considering the temporal association of cutaneous toxicities with triazole antifungals, we speculate that the concomitant use of triazole antifungals inhibited the hepatic metabolism of ATRA, resulting in higher serum ATRA concentration, and markedly accentuated cutaneous toxicities in our patients.',\n",
       "  'Conclusion',\n",
       "  'By highlighting this crucial pharmacokinetic interaction, we want to caution the fellow oncologists to be mindful of the inhibitory effect of triazole antifungals on CYP450. We propose using a non-myelosuppressive combination of ATRA and arsenic trioxide for management of APL hence, obliterating the need of prophylactic antifungals. However, in the event of invasive fungal infection (IFI), we suggest using alternative class of antifungals.',\n",

       "  'Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a rare and potentially curable subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), accounting for 5–8% of AML cases. Genetically, APL is characterized by reciprocal translocation t(15:17) (q22;q11–12), with consequent fusion of promyelocytic (PML) gene on chromosome 15q22 to retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha) gene on chromosome 17q21. The resultant fusion oncoprotein, PML-RARA, induces transcriptional repression, chromatin condensation, maturation arrest, and accumulation of abnormal promyelocytes. Advent of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has revolutionized the treatment landscape of APL, and along with the backbone of anthracycline based chemotherapy, it is considered to be the standard of care for APL patients. Combination treatment with ATRA plus anthracycline based chemotherapy achieves an overall complete remission and cure rate of 95% and 80% respectively, rendering ATRA indispensable in the management of APL.',\n",
       "  'ATRA, an active metabolite of vitamin A, belongs to a class of retinoids. Although retinoids are well known for their dermatological side effects like xerosis, xerostomia, erythema, pruritis, and exfoliation; severe dermatological side effects of ATRA, especially in the dosage pertinent to APL (45\\xa0mg/m2), are rare. So far, only a single case of exfoliative dermatitis (ED) and a few cases of scrotal ulceration have been reported in literature. We, here in, report a case series of three patients with serious and rare ATRA associated dermatological complications. We have also discussed upon the potentially precipitating pharmacokinetic interactions, as well as the detailed clinical course and management of our patients as simply withholding ATRA can jeopardize the outcome of this potentially curable malignant disorder.',\n",

       "  'In all three patients, ATRA was started as soon as abnormal promyelocytes were documented on peripheral smear/bone marrow aspirate examination (Figs.\\xa01, 2, 3). Diagnosis was further confirmed through cytogenetic analysis as well as PML-RARA detection by polymerase chain reaction. Additionally,\\xa0in all three patients, chemotherapeutic treatment was instituted according to European APL protocol, based on their risk-group classification.',\n",
       "  'Case 1: A 33-year-old Asian female presented in ER\\xa0with\\xa0history of fever, heavy menstrual bleeding and rash\\xa0all over body. Induction chemotherapy and steroid prophylaxis was promptly started to prevent differentiation syndrome (DS). On Day-10 of induction chemotherapy, she developed high grade fever, cough and shortness of breath. High-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) showed randomly scattered discrete nodular opacities with surrounding ground glass haze in both lung fields, suggestive of invasive fungal infection (IFI). Voriconazole was immediately started along with broad-spectrum antibiotics. She improved over the following 72 hour, and was discharged from hospital on Day-17. Subsequently, she landed in emergency department on Day-23 with severe dehydration, shivering, tachycardia, generalized skin erythema and discoloration of nail beds. Intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started along with application of local emollients to prevent transdermal water loss. Over the next 24-36\\xa0hour, her general condition was stabilized however; skin exfoliation continued with complete desquamation of palms and soles (Fig.\\xa01). Dermatology was consulted, and a clinical diagnosis of onychomadesis and exfoliative dermatitis (ED) was made. A review of her clinical case demonstrated no apparent cause for ED except for a rare association with ATRA. However, considering the curative potential of ATRA, it was continued till Day-28 as per protocol. Her skin condition gradually resolved over next 10–14\\xa0days after discontinuation of ATRA. She had recurrence of similar skin condition upon re-exposure to ATRA in her consolidation chemotherapeutic cycles, however, the exfoliation was mild and patchy that responded well to good oral hydration and local skin emollients.',\n",
       "  'Case 2: A 28-year-old Asian male presented in the out-patient clinic with the history of generalized weakness, high-grade-fever, productive cough and bruises over body. On examination, he had multiple ecchymosis and petechiae with coarse crepitations involving right-middle and left-lower lung fields. He was promptly started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Additionally, as per protocol, induction chemotherapy and dexamethasone prophylaxis was also instituted. His fever and cough remained unresponsive despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. Voriconazole was instituted upon the identification of IFI on HRCT findings. By day-10, coagulopathy was normalized, and clearance of abnormal promyelocytes was documented by Day-18. On Day-20, he complained of skin dryness, itching and scaling; physical examination revealed generalized xerosis and erythema (Fig.\\xa02). Despite aggressive skin care, generalized skin exfoliation, most pronounced on palms and soles,\\xa0ensued. Clinical diagnosis of ED was established after obtaining dermatological consultation. However, in view of his clinical stability, ATRA was continued. Bone marrow aspirate on Day-28 showed morphological remission. Recurrence of erythema and exfoliation was documented during consolidation phase of chemotherapy, but the condition was responsive to local emollients and oral hydration.',\n",
       "  \"Case 3: A 15-year-old Asian male presented in the out-patient clinic with complains of high-grade-fever, muco-cutaneous bleeding and pancytopenia. On presentation, patient was febrile and had oral thrush. After sending his baseline tests he was taken on broad-spectrum antibiotics and triazole antifungal (itraconazole). After completion of induction chemotherapy, patient was discharged with bi-weekly follow-ups.On Day15, he reported two blackish,\\xa0mildly tender scrotal lesions with minimal serous discharge (Fig.\\xa03). Antibiotic cover for soft tissue infection was commenced along with local wound care with topical steroids and antibiotics. He had no sign of systemic infection/sepsis. Local bacterial & fungal cultures and serological testing for herpes simplex virus were reported negative. Despite adequate local care and optimal antibiotic support, his lesions showed no sign of healing, and two new lesions were developed. Lesion biopsy for histopathological evaluation was declined by the patient. Keeping the rare but reported occurrence of ATRA-induced scrotal ulceration and fournier's gangrene; ATRA was transiently withheld for ten days and the lesions started to regress. However, considering the indispensable role of ATRA in APL, it was reinstituted. Scrotal lesions persisted without any worsening. ATRA was stopped after completion of protocol. Complete resolution of scrotal lesions was documented over the following two weeks.\\xa0Afterwards, he received two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy, but no recurrence was reported.\",\n",
       "  'Discussion and conclusion',\n",
       "  'The antineoplastic role of ATRA remains indispensable in the curative management of APL. It is considered a relatively safe drug with a well-known toxicity profile. Commonly reported adverse events include DS, pseudotumor-cerebri, hypertriglyceridemia, transaminitis, and headache. Although, mild cutaneous toxicities like muco-cutaneous xerosis, photosensitivity, rash, pruritus and sweet’s syndrome are well reported, severe dermatological toxicities are rarely reported in literature. In this case series, we have discussed three cases of ATRA-induced rare dermatological complications in APL.',\n",
       "  'Case 1 and 2 developed ED during remission induction phase of chemotherapy. Literature review revealed only a single reported occurrence of ATRA-induced ED in APL by YonelIpek et al.. ED is a potentially life-threatening cutaneous manifestation that is characterized by diffuse skin erythema and scaling. Various underlying disorders can trigger its onset through a complex interplay of inflammatory cytokines and phagocytes. In contrast to our cases, the case reported by Yonel Ipek et al. developed xerosis in consolidation phase, which akin to our cases started after two weeks of ATRA exposure and rapidly deteriorated to generalized erythroderma and scaling. In both cases, discontinuation of ATRA resulted in complete resolution of ED.',\n",
       "  'In case 3, we have reported ATRA-induced necrotic scrotal ulceration. Literature review revealed that over the last two decades, a total of twenty cases of ATRA-induced scrotal ulceration have been reported. Histopathological evaluation of these lesions revealed atypical granulocytic infiltration, pointing towards the possible etiological role of differentiated APL cells in the pathogenesis. Most of these cases, including ours, developed genital-lesions almost after two weeks of ATRA exposure and remained unresponsive to local and systemic antibiotics. ATRA had to be halted in most of the cases to prevent progression to fournier’s gangrene.',\n",
       "  'Scattered over the span of three years and considered in isolation, it was not initially apparent to us that all three cases had one striking similarity: concomitant use of ATRA and triazole antifungals. ATRA is primary metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Triazole antifungals are notorious for their strong inhibitory effect on CYP450 enzyme system, resulting in supra-therapeutic drug levels and toxicity.',\n",
       "  'Potentiation of serum ATRA levels by inhibition of CYP450 system was first explored by Rigas et al.. This study reported 1.8 times higher serum concentration of ATRA with concomitant use of ketoconazole. Since then a number of cases have reported the augmentation of ATRA-induced toxicities due to this pharmacokinetic interaction. Concomitant use of ATRA and triazole antifungals that is voriconazole and posaconazole has been implicated to cause severe hypercalcemia. Similarly, combination with fluconazole has been reported to cause severe neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.',\n",
       "  'Considering the temporal association of dermatological complications with triazole antifungals in our patients, we speculate that the concomitant use of triazole antifungals inhibited the metabolism of ATRA, resulting in higher serum concentrations and markedly accentuated cutaneous toxicities. A study further strengthening our hypothesis was conducted by Kurzrock et al. to evaluate the maximum tolerable dose of ATRA in myelodysplastic syndrome. The study reported severe dose-limiting cutaneous toxicities, such as generalized desquamation and genital ulceration, at doses\\u2009>\\u2009150 mg/m2/day, compared to mild xerosis and erythema in the dose range of 45–100 mg/m2/day. Akin to our cases, the study reported complete resolution of cutaneous toxicities within 1–2 weeks of ATRA discontinuation.',\n",
       "  'Another important point is the recurrence of ED in both case 1 and 2 during their consolidation chemotherapy cycles, whereas recurrent scrotal ulceration was not documented in case 3. The most likely explanation is the continuation of voriconazole as secondary prophylaxis in patients with invasive fungal infections (IFI) (case 1 and 2), whereas itraconazole was discontinued after remission induction in case 3. This once again underscores the pharmacokinetic potentiation of ATRA-induced cutaneous toxicities by triazole antifungals. An important limitation of our study is that, due to the unavailability of serum voriconazole testing, we couldn’t document serum voriconazole levels, something that could provide valuable insights into the effect of serum azole levels on the severity of cutaneous manifestations.',\n",
       "  'By highlighting this crucial pharmacokinetic interaction and its potentially severe implications, we urge our fellow oncologists to remain vigilant regarding the inhibitory effects of triazole antifungals on the metabolism of ATRA. We propose the use of a non-myelosuppressive combination of ATRA and arsenic trioxide for APL, thereby eliminating the need for prophylactic antifungals. In the case of invasive fungal infections (IFI), we recommend considering alternative classes of antifungals. However, if triazole antifungals are deemed unavoidable, we suggest close monitoring for potential side effects and implementing prophylactic measures as clinically necessary.',\n",

       "  'Candidiasis is an acute or subacute fungal infection caused by fungi that belongs to candida genus, with Candida albicansbeing the most frequent causative agent. Candida kefyr is a rare cause of candidiasis which has been reported in systemic candidiasis and deep infections. However, to date, it has never been reported as a cause in dermatophytosis. We report a case of candidiasis caused by Candida kefyr in a 72-year-old woman with a chief complaint of pruritic erythematous rash on the back from one day prior to admission. Diagnosis was established based on clinical features, direct microscopic examination with 10% potassium hydroxide solution, gram staining. The fungal species was determined by carbohydrate fermentation test which showed a positive result for Candida kefyr. The patient was treated with miconazole cream and fusidic cream and showed significant clinical improvement.',\n",
       "  'Introduction',\n",
       "  'Candidiasis is an acute or subacute fungal infection caused by the fungus of the genus candida, especially Candida albicans, and can affect the mouth, vagina, skin, nails, bronchi or the lungs, sometimes causing septicemia, endocarditis or meningitis. The most common cause of cutaneous candidiasis is Candida albicans. A study showed that Candida albicans (48%) was the most often isolated species from the skin scrapings of cutaneous candidiasis patients, followed by Candida kruzei (16.1%), Candida glabrata (13.5%), Candida kefyr (7.4%), Candida parapsillosis (4.8%), Candida tropicalis (1.7%) and other candida species (8.5%). Candida kefyr is a rare cause of cutaneous candidiasis. Candida infections occur if there are factors that nourish their growth or facilitate tissue invasion, such as weak host immune system. The causative factors consist of endogenous factors, such as physiological changes in pregnancy, obesity, iatrogenic, endocrinopathy, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic disease, age and immunologic, and exogenous factors such as climate, skin cleanliness, foot bath habits and contact with those who suffer the same disease.',\n",
       "  'Candidiasis can be found throughout the world. The incidence of the disease is the same in men and women. This disease can affect all ages increases in infants and elderly. Cutaneous candidiasis is divided into two types namely intertriginous and granulomatous candidiasis. In intertriginous candidiasis, lesions occur on the skin folds of the armpits, groin, intergluteal, breast fold, between fingers or toes, glans penis, and umbilicus in the form of streaks that are demarcated, scaly, wet and erythematous. Lesions are surrounded by dots in the form of small vesicles and pustules or bullae that leave erosive areas. On the other hand, granulomatous candidiasis is more common in children and presents as reddish papules covered in thick brownish yellow crusts and are firmly attached to the base. This lesion may appear like a 2cm long horn and can often be found on the face, head, nails, body, and legs. We report a case of cutaneous candidiasis caused by Candida kefyr in a 72-year-old woman who responded well to topical antifungal therapy.',\n",
       "  'Patient and observation',\n",
       "  'A 72-year-old woman was consulted to the Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital, Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, with a chief complaint of blackish red spots on the posterior trunk since one day before admission. The initial lesion was unknown. Complaints of itching is unknown due to patient´s decreased of consciousness state. The patient had a long history of immobilize for 14 days. History of similar complaint from the family was denied. History of diabetes mellitus was absent. Patient had a history of syphilis with HIV infection and got therapy of intramuscular injection 2.4 million unit of benzathine penicillin G for three consecutive weeks. He was also treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) with tenofovir 300mg, lamivudine 300mg, and efavirenz 600mg.',\n",
       "  'Physical examination showed blood pressure of 100/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 beats per minute, and temperature 36.5°C. Laboratory blood tests were within normal limits. Neurologic examination showed decreased awareness and lateralization of both sides. Dermatological examination of the posterior trunk region found hyperpigmented macules accompanied by crust, squama and erythematous macules (Figure 1). Based on the history taking and physical examination, the patient was diagnosed with sepsis, suspected meningoencephalitis, hypoalbuminemia, community-acquired pneumonia, and cutaneous candidiasis. The patient was given citicoline 500mg/12 hours/IV, omeprazole 40mg/12 hours/IV, ceftriaxone 2gr/12 hours/IV, vancomycin 1gr/12 hours/IV, vitamin B complex 1gr/24 hours/intravenously, acetazolamide 250mg/12 hours/nasogastric tube, and paracetamol 1gr/8 hours/intravenously. Topical fusidic acid cream was also applied on ulcerative lesions to avoid bacterial superinfection. For the cutaneous candidiasis, patient was treated with miconazole cream twice daily in the morning and evening and fusidic acid cream for 14 days. Direct microscopic examination using 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) and culture were done to for further investigation on the causative agent. Direct microscopic of the skin scrapings on the back using 10% KOH showed clustered spores and pseudohyphae (Figure 2). Culture in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) media added with chloramphenicol incubated at 25°-30°C showed mucoid brownish white colonies with smooth surfaces on the third day (Figure 3), typical of the fungus Candida sp. One week later, gram staining was carried out and positive purple color mildews were obtained (Figure 4). There were yeast cells and budding spores which were consistent with candida species. Further examination was carried out using carbohydrate fermentation to determine the type of candida which showed a change in color from purple to orange in glucose, sucrose, and lactose and gas formed in each of the reagents (Figure 5).

In this case, the patient is a 72-year-old woman. According to the literature, the incidence of the disease is the same in men and women. Risk of candidiasis increases in infants and elderly. The diagnosis of candidiasis was made through history taking, physical examination and supporting investigations. On physical examination of the posterior trunk, hyperpigmented macules accompanied by crusting, scales, and erythematous macules were found. According to the literature, in vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by Candida kefyr, irritation and burning are more prominent than itching and is not accompanied by fluor albus. Clinically the main complaints are vaginal erythema, indifferent to that of Candida albicans.',\n",
       "  'Skin scrapings with 10% KOH solution is the easiest and most effective way to diagnose candidiasis but it cannot identify a specific etiology and is less sensitive than culture. Positive skin scraping test for candidiasis show yeast cells, blastospores, or pseudohyphae. In addition, specimens will also show purple color when examined using gram staining. Identification of fungi was done by culturing the specimens on SDA with added antibiotics (chloramphenicol) to prevent bacterial growth. It is a sensitive examination to diagnose candida infections. The culture is incubated at a temperature of 25°- 30°C. After 24-48 hours of culture, white colony was found, rounded convex with a distinctive odor of yeast, wet mucoid surface smooth and wrinkled. Species identification can be done by germ tube test, chlamydospores assessment, assimilation and fermentation tests, and CHROM agar candida. In this case we use carbohydrate fermentation test as this test is low-cost, simple, effective, sensitive, and specific. This process requires carbohydrates as a source of carbon. Kefyr species can assimilate and ferment glucose, sucrose, and lactose. A total of four tubes each containing glucose, maltose, sucrose, and lactose with added phenol red as an indicator were used. A change in color from red to yellow indicates the formation of acids. To determine the formation of gas, durham cylinders that are placed upside down in a test tube were used. The gas formed will appear as an empty chamber in the Durham tube. In Candida kefyr, fermentation can be observed on tubes containing glucose, sucrose, and lactose which is marked by color change and gas formation. In this case, the fermentation carbohydrate test showed positive results in tubes containing glucose, sucrose, and lactose as shown by color change and gas formation, confirming the presence of Candida kefyr.',\n",

       "  'Miconazole nitrate (MCNR), an antifungal drug, is used to treat superficial infections. The objective of the current study was to assess the antifungal effectiveness of MCNR-loaded transethosomal gel (MNTG) against Candida albicans in an in vivo rat model. The outcomes were compared with those of the miconazole nitrate gel (MNG) and marketed Daktarin® cream (2%) based on histopathological and hematological studies. The results of the skin irritation test revealed the safety profile of the MNTG. The MNTG demonstrated the greatest antifungal activity in the histological analysis and the visible restoration of the skin, and the rats revealed an apparent evidence of recovery. Compared to the untreated group, the treated group’s lymphocyte and white blood cells counts increased, but their eosinophil counts decreased. In conclusion, MNTG exhibited the greatest antifungal activity, which might be connected to the improved skin permeability of the transethosome’s nanosized vesicles. Therefore, it could be considered a promising carrier for topical usage and the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis. More clinical research needs to be performed in order to demonstrate its effectiveness and safe usage in humans.',\n",
       "  '1. Introduction',\n",
       "  'Fungal infections are one of the most serious dermatological disorders carried by different types of pathogenic fungi. Over 25% of the world’s population suffers from fungal infections. The root cause of the fungal infection identified as candidiasis is a fungus that looks like yeast called Candida. Some kinds of Candida can infect people; Candida albicans is the most widespread. Without causing any distress, Candida usually resides on the skin as well as in bodily parts like the throat, mouth, vagina, and gut. When Candida overgrows or invades internal organs like the kidney, heart, or brain, for instance, or the circulation, it may result in infections. Candida infection is referred to as candidiasis or candidosis. Currently, one of the most challenging diseases to treat in humans is fungal infection. Patients with severe underlying conditions (e.g., cancer) or immunocompromised patients are at a greater risk of developing invasive and fatal fungal infections. More than 300 million individuals worldwide are believed to have a deadly fungal infection that has killed 1.4 million people a year, with Aspergillus and Candida species accounting for the majority of infections. Although superficial mycosis is the most widespread fungal infection.',\n",
       "  'Antifungal medications of many types are offered to treat invasive cutaneous as well as fungal infections on the skin. Only a few types of antifungal medications are available despite an increase in the occurrence of fungal infections, predominantly in immunocompromised individuals, and they show only little success in the management of infections that pose a serious threat to life. Azoles are some of these medications.',\n",
       "  'Treatment for candidiasis is provided by the broad-spectrum antifungal drug miconazole nitrate (MCNR), which belongs to the imidazole group. MCNR has minimal systemic effectiveness because of its inadequate water solubility (less than 1 µg/mL) and extensive hepatic transformation. The drug’s systemic delivery can also cause patients to experience some of the renowned adverse pharmacological reactions, such as nausea, abdominal pain, bloating, and vomiting. The mechanism of action of MCNR depends on the suppression of ergosterol production, which leads to the lysis of fungal cell membranes and the suppression of peroxidase, which causes a buildup of peroxide inside the cell and cell death. Due to inadequate skin penetration, the topical administration of MCNR is troublesome in the treatment of cutaneous disorders. To evade this problem and formation for inadequate permeability, conventional formulations have to be taken at higher doses.',\n",
       "  'Lipid vesicles have recently received a lot of focus as carriers for topical medications because they are able to circumvent the skin’s innate barrier functions. The incredibly flexible vesicles known as transethosomes have a bilayer structure. They can readily squeak across the intracellular lipid of the stratum corneum to infiltrate the skin and defeat the barrier function. Transethosomes are an innovative method of drug administration that is frequently used for topical treatments. Transethosomes are vesicular carriers that are flexible and soft. Transethosomes are made up of ethanol, edge activators, and phospholipids. Transethosomes are spherical and uneven, and have a higher degree of elasticity and skin permeation/penetration. This is attributed to the lipid bilayer of these vesicle changes as a result of the interaction between the ethanolic effect and an edge activator or surfactant. Different permeability enhancers and edge activators are employed to generate transethosomal systems with improved characteristics.',\n",
       "  'MCNR is suggested to be formulated in a topical dosage form in order to get over these limitations. Owing to the fact that transethosomes have a higher drug penetration across the skin into subcutaneous tissues and a higher entrapment efficiency than other vesicular carriers such as niosomes and liposomes, their usage in topical systems for drug delivery is growing. Due to the transethosomes’ small size and ability to distort the skin obstruction and subsequently pass through the skin layer’s confined intercellular space intact, they have a greater potential for drug administration. The high ethanol content permits the transethosomes to disrupt the lipid bilayer, which makes the skin more malleable and makes it easier for drugs to be absorbed. In addition to transethosomes’ deformability, its high content of ethanol permits the lipid membrane to organize less densely than in ordinary vesicles without impacting the structures’ durability and elasticity. Moreover, transethosomes components are non-invasive, safe, and now authorized for use in pharmaceuticals.',\n",
       "  'Transethosomes can entrap a variety of lipophilic, lipophobic, and amphiphilic medications, peptides, proteins, and other active medicinal components. It is possible to administer these transethosomes that are drug-entrapped in semisolid dosage forms like gel and cream. In cases of fungal infections, topical therapies are suggested as opposed to systemic ones. Transethosomes have been discovered to offer a potential advantage for the topical and transdermal delivery of antifungal medications for localized fungal infections of the skin. Drugs can be given directly to the area of localized infections using topical preparations in a controlled drug delivery profile. The drug can avoid the hepatic first-pass metabolism since it is not absorbed into the systemic bloodstream from the gut. Patient compliance may additionally be enhanced by providing a less complicated drug distribution route.',\n",
       "  'Based on our previous study, MCNR-loaded transethosomes (MCNR-TEs) were prepared and physicochemically characterized. MNTG was safe and a non-irritant, and exhibited an increased in vitro antifungal activity against Candida albicans. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the antifungal efficacy of MNTG against Candida albicans in an in vivo rat model. Histological examinations and the in vivo therapeutic effectiveness of the formulations were evaluated.',\n",
       "  '2. Results and Discussion',\n",
       "  '2.1. Patch Test (Skin Irritancy Test)',\n",
       "  'Pharmaceutical products are usually administered topically. A variety of skin reactions such as itchiness or allergic reactions might happen including redness, edema, leaking, scaling, and crusting. When developing a pharmaceutical product, it is important to ensure that all of its ingredients are safe to use on the skin. One experimental in vivo method for determining a pharmaceutical product’s capacity to irritate the skin is the 24 h patch test. It has also been shown that a patch test works better to anticipate skin sensitization reactions than a visual estimation of the inflammatory response. The investigation on skin irritation was executed on healthy albino rats.',\n",
       "  'By performing skin irritation tests on healthy Wistar albino rats (females), the potential for skin irritation of MNG, MNTG, and the marketed cream (Daktarin® cream 2%) was identified. The skin irritancy potential was evaluated by observing the progression of edema and erythema on rats’ skin. The primary cutaneous irritancy index score for MNG, MNTG, and the marketed cream (Daktarin® cream 2%) was analyzed as shown in Table 1.',\n",
       "  'According to skin irritation test, the transethosomal gel formulation was harmless to rat skin. On the rat’s skin, erythema and edema started to appear. The rats in group V (treated with MNTG) did not exhibit any serious erythema or edema development symptoms over the entire 48 h period. The rats in group III (treated with MNG) displayed severe edema and moderate erythema signs after 48 h. However, rats in group IV (treated with the marketed cream) showed minor edema. The primary cutaneous irritancy index scores for MNG, the marketed cream (Daktarin® cream 2%), and MNTG were determined to be 2.9, 0.9, and 0.6 respectively, as demonstrated in Table 1. The rat skin after the application of MNTG, MNG, and the marketed cream is shown in Figure 1.',\n",
       "  'The data were subjected to a paired sample t-test and a two-way ANOVA. A significant difference between MNTG, MNG, and the marketed cream was observed. Compared to a usual irritant, MNTG’s irritancy score was significantly reduced (p ≤ 0.05).',\n",
       "  'This may be due to intact vesicles penetrating deeply and reducing miconazole nitrate molecules’ direct contact with skin. In other words, the nanocarriers shielded the skin from miconazole nitrate’s direct cutaneous contact. It may be concluded that the formulated MNTG is less of an irritant, well-tolerated, and secure for skin application.',\n",
       "  '2.2. Treatment Effect of the Gels',\n",
       "  'The assessment of an antifungal’s efficacy is frequently carried out using Candida albicans. Figure 2 demonstrates the difference in animal skin before and after inducing a fungal infection, as well as a comparison of the skin following the treatment with MNG gel, the marketed cream (Daktarin® cream 2%), and MNTG (transethosomal gel) for 10 days.',\n",
       "  'All animals displayed a normal skin structure prior to the induction of a cutaneous fungal infection, devoid of any clinical signs of fungal infection, such as swelling, edema, color changes, or cracking, as illustrated in Figure 2. The animals displayed red patchy areas, inflammation, scaling, edema, and skin cracking after the induction of the fungus. The infected rats were examined daily for indications of infection. The day after the subsequent instillation of the Candida albicans suspension in all of the animals, the first symptoms of infection in the form of skin redness were noticed. On the third day, it was more pronounced as scaling and obviously distinct skin redness.',\n",
       "  'After five days of treatment, the infection site showed signs of shedding of the infectious scales, revealing skin that was light pink in color. There were no significant changes in the structure of the skin after MNG gel treatment. The edema and inflammation accompanying the irritation decreased after 10 days of treatment with the marketed cream (Daktarin® cream 2%), but the scars still remained. The MNTG, on the other hand, demonstrated normal skin after 10 days of treatment, as shown in Figure 2.',\n",
       "  'When compared to other formulations, the treatment for a fungal infection using the MNTG demonstrated a significant reduction in fungal infection, signifying that it is a more effective remedy. The outcomes of an in vivo antifungal trial revealed that the MNTG was more effective in eradicating Candida albicans-induced infections and minimizing its symptoms. This might be due to the drug’s increased ability to pierce deeper layers of skin, increasing its capability to remain in the skin. Drug retention in the skin is also influenced synergistically by the presence of the edge activator (oleic acid). The combined effects of the edge activator and ethanol, which function as permeation enhancers, increased the effectiveness of permeation even more. In contrast, due to the non-flexibility of the gel formulation, it is restricted to the stratum corneum surface layers and does not penetrate deeper areas of skin.',\n",
       "  'According to these findings, the antifungal activity of the formulations studied above is in the following order: Transethosomal gel (MNTG) > Marketed cream (Daktarin® cream 2%) > MNG gel.',\n",
       "  '2.3. Histological Examination',\n",
       "  'The histopathological analysis is another aspect that provides proof for the test of antifungal activity. Similar to this research study, Zhang et al. employed the H&E approach to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment they used in their investigation of skin wounds. In this investigation, like in Wahedi et al., the histological aspects were evaluated using H&E for the improved condition of skin tissue following a cure for a fungal infection. All five groups’ slides were examined using a compound microscope.',\n",
       "  'A histopathological examination was carried out on healthy albino rats’ skin (negative control) and infected rats’ skin. The histological images of group I (negative control, non-infected), group II (positive control, infected, without receiving treatment), group III (infected and treated with MNG), group IV (infected and treated with the marketed cream), and group V (infected and treated with MNTG) are shown in Figure 3.',\n",
       "  'The negative control group (group I), as anticipated, presented a normal histological texture of the skin in the stained areas in 10 days of investigation. The dermis and epidermis layers of the skin of normal animals (Group I) were even, with no changes to the skin’s natural structure (marked with blue and black arrow). The blood vessels, collagen bundles, hair follicles, and sebaceous units were all visible in their usual sizes and shapes on the stained sections of a normal rat. Second, the infection-induced group (group II) experienced various pathological incidents, such as focal acanthosis (green arrow) with a trivial compact hyperkeratosis layer (red arrow), during the course of the 10 days but showed no recovery. The dermis layer had extensive, chronic inflammation, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the necrotic tissue region at the same moment as fungal hyphae appeared in the overlying epidermal layer (black arrow); and focal interface dermatitis (marked by blue arrow) also became visible. Third, after 10 days of treatment, the MNG-treated group (group III) exhibited only a very minor improvement. They demonstrated a slow recovery to normal skin morphology but did not completely eliminate inflammatory cells and recover the normal skin structure, as illustrated in Figure 3. The dermis and epidermal layer improved over the course of 10 days in the fourth group (group IV), which received treatment with the marketed cream (Daktarin® cream 2%), with the exception of the skin appendages and focal acanthosis in H&E-stained segments.',\n",
       "  'Fifth, in the MNTG-treated group (group V), the skin tissues were fully recovered and showed considerable improvements in terms of rehabilitation from fungal infection. Group V demonstrated full restoration, a nearly normal tissue appearance, and a uniform morphology of skin in the dermis and epidermis layers, which may be associated with the transethosomes’s ability to penetrate multiple skin layers due to their nano-size to speed up the treatment of a fungus infection. Moreover, edge activators’ inclusion in the chemical makeup of transethosomes improves skin penetration by making the transethosomal lipid bilayer more fluid and, thereby, making it easier for them to squeak into the skin pores. Additionally, the high ethanol content increases skin permeability through two different processes: first, it intermingles with stratum corneum lipid molecules, altering their packaging of skin lipids and resulting in an upsurge in their permeability and fluidity; second, it makes transethosomal lipid bilayers more flexible and enhances their fluidity, which improves their ability to penetrate skin. This enables a great permeability of MCNR in the case of MNTG, in contrast to the marketed cream (Daktarin® cream 2%) and MNG, which contain free drug and have a low ability to penetrate the skin.',\n",
       "  '2.4. Hematological Analysis of Total and Differential WBC Count',\n",
       "  'To ascertain the test animals’ immunological condition, a hematology investigation was performed. In normal, infected, and treated groups of rats, the total and differential counts of WBC were assessed.',\n",
       "  'In the current study, the treated group’s mean WBC count was significantly higher than that of the untreated group, as demonstrated in Table 2. It is tempting to speculate that the MNTG protects rats from Candida albicans infection since the elevated WBC count suggests a normal state and indicates the absence of infection. In the differential count, lymphocytes were higher in number in the treated group than in the untreated group. When compared to the untreated and infected groups of rats, the lymphocytes were more abundant in the treated and normal groups of rats. After immunosuppression with prednisolone (5 mg/kg body weight), the lymphocytes in the untreated and infected groups of rats drastically decreased. The eosinophil count, however, displayed a contrary trend, as represented in Table 3.',\n",
       "  'The average gap between cells in the skin, according to Kaur et al., 2017b and Kaur et al., 2017 is 70 nm. Typical semisolid therapies, such as creams and lotions, permeate the skin more slowly. Transethosomal gel instantly penetrates the skin, delivering the active ingredients deeper and quicker, treating the infection, and normalizing the skin condition.',\n",

The study’s findings indicate that the MNTG can be used as a topical drug delivery system with improved antifungal efficacy. This suggests a way to get around the higher doses of MCNR needed for distinctive topical administration, systemic side effects, and frequently received applications.

       "  'ABSTRACT',\n",
       "  'Cutaneous candidiasis, caused by Candida albicans, is a severe and frustrating condition, and finding effective treatments can be challenging. Therefore, the development of farnesol-loaded nanoparticles is an exciting breakthrough. Ethosomes are a novel transdermal drug delivery carrier that incorporates a certain concentration (10–45%) of alcohols into lipid vesicles, resulting in improved permeability and encapsulation rates compared to conventional liposomes. Farnesol is a quorum-sensing molecule involved in morphogenesis regulation in C. albicans, and these ethosomes offer a promising new approach to treating this common fungal infection. This study develops the formulation of farnesol-loaded ethosomes (farnesol-ethosomes) and assesses applications in treating cutaneous candidiasis induced by C. albicans in vitro and in vivo. Farnesol-ethosomes were successfully developed by ethanol injection method. Therapeutic properties of farnesol-ethosomes, such as particle size, zeta potential, and morphology, were well characterized. According to the results, farnesol-ethosomes demonstrated an increased inhibition effect on cells’ growth and biofilm formation in C. albicans. In Animal infection models, treating farnesol-ethosomes by transdermal administration effectively relieved symptoms caused by cutaneous candidiasis and reduced fungal burdens in quantity. We also observed that ethosomes significantly enhanced drug delivery efficacy in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that farnesol-ethosomes can provide future promising roles in curing cutaneous candidiasis.',\n",
       "  'IMPORTANCE',\n",
       "  'Cutaneous candidiasis attributed to Candida infection is a prevalent condition that impacts individuals of all age groups. As a type of microbial community, biofilms confer benefits to host infections and mitigate the clinical effects of antifungal treatments. In C. albicans, the yeast-to-hypha transition and biofilm formation are effectively suppressed by farnesol through its modulation of multiple signaling pathway. However, the characteristics of farnesol such as hydrophobicity, volatility, degradability, and instability in various conditions can impose limitations on its effectiveness. Nanotechnology holds the potential to enhance the efficiency and utilization of this molecule. Treatment of farnesol-ethosomes by transdermal administration demonstrated a very remarkable therapeutic effect against C. albicans in infection model of cutaneous candidiasis in mice. Many patients suffering fungal skin infection will benefit from this study.',\n",
       "  'INTRODUCTION',\n",
       "  'The prevalence of clinical Candida infection remains high due to the increasing use of immunosuppressants, organ transplantation, and antibiotics in cancer chemotherapy. Cutaneous candidiasis is a common skin disease caused by Candida species that can affect patients of all ages. This disease accounts for approximately 1% of outpatients and 7% of dermatological clinic patients. Patients may experience candidiasis in all body regions, including intertrigo, cheilitis, diaper dermatitis, and interdigital candidiasis. Candida albicans is the most prevalent among all candidiasis-causing fungi.',\n",
       "  'C. albicans is known for its highly versatile adaptability to the host environment, achieved by switching between budding yeast cells and filamentous pseudohyphal and hyphal cells. Its morphogenesis regulation in response to the host environment is essential to its virulence. Once it adheres to host surfaces like mucosal surfaces, epithelial cell linings, and parenchymal organs, yeast cells transit to hyphae cells, and biofilms initiate formation. Biofilms help increase adherence to host surfaces, enhance the establishment of infections in the hosts, and protect pathogens from host defenses and drugs. As a form of microbial communities, biofilms benefit pathogens with spatial stability and independence by governing their microenvironment. Biofilms in C. albicans are arranged in a bilayer structure containing large amount of yeast and hyphal cells. C. albicans biofilms also employ a range of mechanisms to tolerate antifungals available for clinical application, and these mechanisms differ depending on the stages of biofilm formation. Therefore, developing novel antifungals with more activities in this microenvironment is crucial. As a result, the search for potential antifungals that inhibit the formation of biofilms in C. albicans, such as farnesol, has attracted considerable attention.',\n",
       "  'Farnesol is a byproduct of sterol biosynthesis and acts as a quorum-sensing molecule (QSM) in C. albicans. Quorum sensing is a unique mechanism by which microorganisms sense their population density and regulate gene expression in response to accumulated QSM in the extracellular environment. This phenomenon promotes cell-to-cell communication to synchronize single cells as multicellular organisms. In C. albicans, farnesol significantly inhibits the yeast-to-hypha transition and biofilm formation by targeting several signaling pathways, such as hyphal initiation and maintenance. Virulence-associated characteristics of C. albicans influenced by farnesol make it a potential novel antifungal drug. Farnesol is also known to have inhibitory effects on other fungi and bacteria, such as Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida parapsilosis, Candida dubliniensis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The trait of farnesol is highly hydrophobic and volatile, and many factors, such as high temperatures, humidity, light, and oxygen, cause farnesol degradation. As a result, the hydrophobicity and instability of farnesol limits its bioavailability as a potential antifungal drug against C. albicans. Although topical use of farnesol is generally safe, it can cause skin irritation due to allergic reactions. Nanoparticles might be an effective tool to improve farnesol bioavailability with the development of nanotechnology.',\n",
       "  'Cutaneous candidiasis is currently treated with topical and oral therapies with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antifungal effects. Transdermal drug delivery is more moderate for therapeutic agent administration than other routes. This method can improve medication bioavailability by designating medicines in a specific skin region and decreasing the possibility of adverse effects. Additionally, functional nanoparticles offer an attractive solution for transdermal drug delivery. These nanoparticles have unique physicochemical features, such as nanoscale effect, form, stiffness, thermo-responsiveness, surface charge, and pH responsiveness. These intrinsic features affect skin penetration and improve the transdermal capacity by interacting with biological molecules, making nanoparticles enhance skin penetration efficacy better than a skin surface reservoir. Among these nanoparticles, ethosomes containing higher concentration alcohols such as ethanol and isopropyl alcohol form lipid vesicles with enhanced permeability and encapsulation rate, and show excellent stability and skin tolerance. Therefore, whether farnesol-loaded nanoparticles can treat cutaneous candidiasis caused by C. albicans is worth considering.',\n",
       "  'This study aims to investigate using ethosomes as a nanocarrier for farnesol entrapment. The study evaluated therapeutic properties such as particle size, zeta potential, and farnesol-ethosome entrapment efficiency. We assessed the antifungal activity of farnesol-ethosomes against yeast cells in C. albicans in vitro using the minimum inhibitory concentration. The matured biofilm in response to farnesol-ethosomes was then determined in C. albicans cells. The study also determined the expression pattern of genes involved in dimorphic switching control in response to farnesol-ethosomes. Moreover, we constructed an animal model of cutaneous candidiasis to determine the effect of farnesol-ethosomes against C. albicans cells in mice. Then, coumarin 6-ethosomes were developed to evaluate the effect of ethosomes on drug delivery efficacy in C. albicans cells and animal models. We also assessed farnesol-ethosome cytotoxicity in mammalian cells and animal models. Our data demonstrate in vitro that these novelty farnesol-ethosomes are active against C. albicans cells. The ethosome delivery systems demonstrated higher drug delivery efficacy compared to traditional therapy in vitro and vivo. Farnesol-ethosomes also showed optimistic results in the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis induced by C. albicans, suggesting excellent prospects in treating cutaneous candidiasis.',\n",

About 10 µL farnesol solution (0.4 M) was mixed thoroughly into the ethanol solution under ultrasonic conditions by a Scientz-II D probe sonicator (Ningbo Scientz Biotechnology Co., LTD, Zhejiang, China) at 100 W for 3 min in an ice bath. The prepared farnesol-ethosomes solution was injected into 0.6 mL of deionized water under ultrasonic conditions. The obtained farnesol-ethosomes (4 mM) were stored at 4°C for further research. The preparation of C6 loaded ethosomes was identical to the above procedure, except that C6 solution was added into ethanol solution instead of farnesol solution.',\n",

First, the ethosome sample was added to the upper chamber of an Ultra centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corporation, USA), and centrifuged for 25 min at 5000 rpm (Shanghai Anting TDL-60B, China) to separate nanoparticles from the aqueous suspension medium. The unentrapped farnesol in the filtrate was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography method.

Briefly, one drop of ethosome sample was dropped onto a 200-mesh copper grid covered with carbon film and drained with filter paper. As a negative stain, 1.5% phosphotungstic acid was administered for 20 min and dried naturally for 24 h for observation.

The results are shown in Fig. 1E, indicating that the farnesol-ethosomes cell viability rate is concentration-dependent. In groups treated with 300 and 400 µM farnesol-ethosomes, the cell viability rate of yeast cells in C. albicans was approximately 43%. Conversely, the cell viability rate was generally 100% in groups treated with farnesol in DMSO. Farnesol-ethosomes showed increased inhibition effects on yeast cells’ growth at concentrations more than 250 µM, whereas farnesol in DMSO ineffectively inhibited cell growth in all tested concentrations. This result indicated that C. albicans was more tolerant to farnesol than farnesol-ethosomes.',\n",
       "  'Biofilm growth of C. albicans in response to farnesol-ethosomes in vitro',\n",
       "  'C. albicans can seriously threaten human health by forming biofilms on the body surfaces during infection. These biofilms are complex communities of three-dimensional yeasts with different shapes, including a round-to-oval cell, hyphae with thin, tubal cell, and pseudohyphal with features of both yeast and hyphae. Hyphae formation is crucial in the infection process, and it is vital in the morphogenesis aspect of the C. albicans virulence since it enables the fungus to escape from immune cells and produce proteinase-disrupting tissues. Farnesol, a molecule that regulates the transcription factors responsible for the transition of hyphae to yeast, has shown promising results in controlling hyphae formation. We determine whether a change in ethosome drug delivery could decrease hyphae formation in C. albicans during biofilm growth in vitro.',\n",
       "  'However, the effectiveness of farnesol is limited due to poor drug delivery methods. Ethosomes offer a unique solution to this problem by providing a more efficient and targeted delivery of farnesol to the affected area. Ethosomal farnesol can significantly reduce the severity of C. albicans infections by reducing hyphae formation. This study built the matured C. albicans biofilm model and tested farnesol-ethosomes activity in controlling hyphae formation, depicting the results in Fig. 2. Increased drug concentration in groups treated with farnesol (Fig. 2A through C) has led to observable cell-type switching in C. albicans. Although confocal microscopy revealed the presence of three types of C. albicans cells at 100 µM farnesol treatment, alike to the control group (Fig. 2G), the proportion of hyphal cells significantly decreased. At 200 µM farnesol (Fig. 2B), the biofilm structure transitioned from a dense status into a loose one, and hyphal cells were rare but still visible. The disappearance of hyphal cells and prevalence of yeast cells was observed in groups treated with 800 µM farnesol (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that farnesol, as a quorum-sensing molecule, regulated cell-type switching from hyphal cells to yeast cells in matured biofilms. The proportion of hyphal cells is negatively correlated with the quantity of farnesol in the environment. As a result, the intensity of cell-type switching regulated by farnesol is concentration-dependent. Cell-type switching in C. albicans was also observed by confocal microscopy in farnesol-ethosomes treatment groups (Fig. 2D through F). Interestingly, hyphal cells were rarely observed in groups treated with 100 µM farnesol-ethosomes (Fig. 2D), similar to the observation in groups treated with 800 µM farnesol. This result was reproduced in groups treated with 200 and 800 µM farnesol-ethosomes (Fig. 2E and F). The results indicated that 200 and 800 µM farnesol-ethosomes treatments overdose in regulating cell-type switching in matured biofilms. Therefore, cell-type switching in C. albicans is intensively regulated in response to farnesol-ethosomes treatment versus farnesol treatment.',\n",

The results shown in Fig. 2H indicate that the expression of HWP1, ALS3, RAS1, EED1, and UME6 significantly reduced following treatment with 400 µM farnesol. Notably, Als3 and Hwp1, family members of the agglutinin-like sequence (Als), function as cell wall adhesins in C. albicans. Hwp1 is also expressed on the C. albicans hyphal cell surface. HWP1 and ALS3 belonging to early hyphae-specific genes are essential for C. albicans cell-cell interactions during the initiation step of hyphae formation. Hyphae initiation and long-term maintenance are equally required for hyphal growth. The activation of UME6 expression through Eed1 is required for long-term maintenance of hyphae-specific gene expression.',\n",
       "  'Farnesol binds to the cyclase domain of the adenylyl cyclase Cyr1, directly affecting intracellular cAMP levels and promoting the cleavage of Ras1 to deactivate Cyr1 indirectly. Moreover, farnesol’s inhibitory function on the Ras1-cAMP-PKA cascade helps maintain yeast cell formation. The transcriptional activators such as Efg1, Eed1, and Ume6 are involved in the farnesol response, but their specific contributions remain largely unknown. A detailed representation of the transduction of farnesol leading to the inhibition of hyphae formation can be seen in Fig. 2I. These results suggest that farnesol greatly inhibits the expression of genes involving hyphae formation and maintenance in C. albicans.',\n",

       "  'A mouse model of cutaneous candidiasis induced by C. albicans was conducted to evaluate farnesol-ethosomes’ efficacy in vivo. The study involved the male Kunming mice subcutaneously infected with C. albicans for 3 days in situ to establish an infected model. After this, 24 mice with C. albicans cells’ infection were randomly divided into four groups and treated respectively with PBS, 400 µM farnesol, 400 µM farnesol-ethosomes, and 4 mM farnesol-ethosomes via transdermal drug delivery. The treatment was initiated on Day 1, and lesion sites were photographed daily using a camera. On day 10 post-treatment, the mice were sacrificed, and the skin tissues at the lesion site were dissected and homogenized for fungal burden tests. Fig. 3 presents the results. In the control group (Fig. 3A), erythematous papules appeared at the lesion site on day 1 and visible nodules on day 6. The nodules grew in size and were apparently on day 10, indicating the formation of lymphocutaneous at primary lesion sites by subcutaneous infection. The results obtained in the 400 µM farnesol treatment group were similar (Fig. 3B). However, 400 µM farnesol treatment caused no apparent changes in lymphocutaneous. In two farnesol-ethosomes treatment groups (Fig. 3C and D), erythematous papules were also observed at the lesion site on day 1. Interestingly, ulcers appeared on day 3, and the open wounds continued to heal until closure. Only a slight mark was observed at the lesion site on day 10. The disappearance of lymphocutaneous at the lesion site and intact skin structure show that farnesol-ethosomes treatment almost healed the infected skin. There was no significant difference between the two farnesol-ethosomes treatment groups. It seems that the escalation in dosage dose not yield a substantial enhancement in the therapeutic efficacy. We also observed a noticeable reduction in fungal burdens between farnesol-ethosomes treatment groups and the control group (Fig. 3E). We observed a striking significant reduction in lower numbers of CFU in the skins of both farnesol-ethosomes treatment groups compared to the farnesol treatment group, indicating a 12.4-fold decrease in 400 µM farnesol-ethosomes treatment group and 31-fold in 4 mM farnesol-ethosomes treatment group. However, the numbers of CFU in the 4 mM farnesol-ethosomes treatment group were only 2.5-fold higher than that in the 400 µM farnesol-ethosomes treatment group. These results suggest that farnesol-ethosomes’ antifungal activity significantly improves in treating cutaneous candidiasis using transdermal administration in mice versus farnesol in ordinary drugs. The farnesol-ethosomes fungistatic effect is highly correlated with encapsulation by nanoparticles.',\n",

We quantitatively examined C. albicans cells uptake C6-ethosomes by confocal microscopy to determine the effect of ethosomes on drug delivery efficacy in vitro Fig. 4A shows C6 uptake into yeast cells at different time courses in C. albicans. The result indicated that the fluorescence intensity of C6 reached the maximum in yeast cells at 3 h. The maximum level of the fluorescence intensity lasted until 6 h and decreased at 9 h. These results suggest that the fluorescence intensity of C6 varies with time courses. In the C6-ethosomes treatment group (Fig. 4B), changes in fluorescence intensity of C6 similarly depended on time courses. However, the maximum fluorescence intensity appearing in the C6-ethosomes treatment group was more than that in the C6 treatment group, precisely at 3 and 6 h. These results suggest that the rate of fluorescent probe C6 uptake in yeast cells varies between C6-ethosomes and C6 treatment groups. Furthermore, the fluorescence signals in each group were quantified as the mean gray value as determined by ImageJ (Fig. 4C). The mean gray value in the C6-ethosomes treatment group reached its peak at 6 h, which is 47.7% higher than the highest value of C6 at 3 h. The improved mean gray value in the C6-ethosomes treatment group could be attributed to the increased accumulation of the fluorescent probes in cytoplasm.

       "  'The therapeutic effect of farnesol-ethosomes will be exaggerated if the toxicity is ignored partly, even if transdermal delivery of farnesol-ethosomes against cutaneous candidiasis is limited in specific areas of the skin. A mouse model was used to study the effects of farnesol-ethosomes on skin tissue and evaluate the cytotoxicity of farnesol-ethosomes in vivo. This study randomly divided 15 male mice into three groups and served them respectively with PBS, 400 µM farnesol, and 400 µM farnesol-ethosomes through transdermal administration for 10 days. Mice were sacrificed, and skin tissues were dissected for pathological sections. H&E staining of skin (Fig. 5A through C) shows no noticeable pathological changes among the control group (Fig. 5A), farnesol treatment group (Fig. 5B), and farnesol-ethosomes treatment group (Fig. 5C). Three layers in skin structure, including epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue, were intact, and noticeable lesions were not observed. Their results indicated farnesol-ethosomes treatment by transdermal administration in mice would be safe. A cytotoxicity assay was performed in mammalian cells to test the safety of farnesol-ethosomes in vitro. Then, 293T cells received farnesol-ethosomes treatment, and the cell viability rate was calculated, as shown in Fig. 5D. The cell viability rate of 293T cells in response to farnesol-ethosomes was concentration-dependent. Treatment with farnesol-ethosomes less than 100 µM resulted in a cell viability rate of approximately 95% in 293T cells, while it decreased to approximately 36% at 400 µM farnesol-ethosomes treatment. These findings suggest that farnesol-ethosomes treatment would be safe at concentrations less than 100 µM in vitro. However, the farnesol-ethosomes dosage for treating cutaneous candidiasis should be carefully determined. Considering the antifungal activity of farnesol-ethosomes in vivo, 400 µM farnesol-ethosomes are recommended in treating mouse models of cutaneous candidiasis induced by C. albicans.

       "  'DISCUSSION',\n",
       "  'This study successfully developed farnesol-ethosomes as a novel treatment for cutaneous candidiasis induced by C. albicans in mice. The farnesol-ethosomes were found to be spherical with proper particle size, exhibited great EE and DL, and showed good storage stability at 25°C for 2 weeks. Farnesol-ethosomes showed an increased inhibition effect against yeast cells at concentrations more than 300 µM in C. albicans. Although the most remarkable ability of farnesol is to affect C. albicans morphology with no effects on yeast cells’ growth in C. albicans, increased ROS production and disruption of mitochondrial function have been proposed to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death induced by farnesol in C. albicans. Farnesol-ethosomes increase antifungal activity compared to farnesol’s conventional form, most likely due to the increase in solubility and stability by nanoencapsulation.',\n",
       "  'During biofilm growth, farnesol-ethosomes promoted the switching from hyphae cells to yeast cells by decreasing the expression of hyphae-related genes in C. albicans. Expressions of certain genes, such as HWP1 and ALS3, responsible for hyphae formation and maintenance, were more inhibited in response to a 400 µM farnesol-ethosomes treatment. Farnesol-ethosomes seem to have a more significant inhibitory effect on genes participating in hyphae formation and maintenance at the transcriptional level. Recent studies have suggested that the sub-apical collar region in filamentous fungi exhibits a higher concentration of endocytosis-related activities and is essential for hyphal growth. It is possible that the incorporation of ethosomes could potentially enhance the uptake process during biofilm formation in C. albicans. Therefore, encapsulation of farnesol in ethosomes improves the effect of farnesol in regulating morphogenesis and controlling cell growth in C. albicans.',\n",
       "  'Surprisingly, farnesol-ethosomes exhibited enhanced antifungal activity in vivo. Transdermal administration of farnesol-ethosomes in mice significantly reduced symptoms of cutaneous candidiasis induced by C. albicans. Fungal burden analysis demonstrated a dramatic decline in the quantity of C. albicans cells in farnesol-ethosomes treatment groups compared to farnesol alone, strongly suggesting improved therapeutic efficacy. The development of ethosomes on drug delivery efficacy was evaluated using fluorescent probe C6 in C. albicans cells and mice model. Encapsulation by ethosomes proved higher efficacy in vitro and in vivo drug delivery than traditional dosages. The limited drug delivery efficacy of C6 in ordinary drugs, due to the barrier in stratum corneum in the epidermis, can be associated with limitation in small, lipophilic molecules by passive diffusion. However, the vesicle structure formed by ethosomes directly penetrates the stratum corneum. Due to the higher concentration of alcohol in phospholipid layer, ethosomes have better flexibility and membrane fluidity than the other nanoparticles such as liposomes. Alcohol is also able to reduce the critical temperature of lipid in stratum corneum and increase its fluidity. Therefore, the penetration depth by ethosomes is much deeper, and the drug transdermal efficiency is significantly improved. Meanwhile, the dense and structure of the stratum corneum in skin is disrupted by phospholipids in ethosomes fusing with the stratum corneum lipids. The drug is released from the vesicles and penetrates into the skin. Therefore, ethosomes can be a promising nanocarrier for farnesol in transdermal delivery. More importantly, farnesol-ethosomes’ safety was verified in mice and 293T cells. Our study demonstrated the superior features of farnesol-ethosomes in treating cutaneous candidiasis induced by C. albicans. It also provides clinical treatment of dermatomycoses with a novel insight.',\n",

       "  'New three-dimensionally-structured hybrid phospholipid vesicles, able to load clotrimazole in a high amount (10 mg/mL), were obtained for the first time in this work by significantly reducing the amount of water (≤10%), which was replaced with a mixture of glycerol and ethanol (≈90%). A pre-formulation study was carried out to evaluate the effect of both the composition of the hydrating medium and the concentration of the phospholipid on the physico-chemical properties of hybrid vesicles. Four different three-dimensionally-structured hybrid vesicles were selected as ideal systems for the topical application of clotrimazole. An extensive physico-chemical characterization performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), 31P-NMR, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) displayed the formation of small, multi-, and unilamellar vesicles very close to each other, and was capable of forming a three-dimensional network, which stabilized the dispersion. Additionally, the dilution of the dispersion with water reduced the interactions between vesicles, leading to the formation of single unilamellar vesicles. The evaluation of the in vitro percutaneous delivery of clotrimazole showed an improved drug deposition in the skin strata provided by the three-dimensionally-structured vesicles with respect to the commercial cream (Canesten®) used as a reference. Hybrid vesicles were highly biocompatible and showed a significant antifungal activity in vitro, greater than the commercial cream Canesten®. The antimycotic efficacy of formulations was confirmed by the reduced proliferation of the yeast cells at the site of infection in vivo. In light of these results, clotrimazole-loaded, three-dimensionally-structured hybrid vesicles appear to be one of the most innovative and promising formulations for the treatment of candidiasis infections.',\n",
       "  '1. Introduction',\n",
       "  'The skin is the main barrier and defence of our body and, for this reason, it is susceptible to different infections and inflammations. Fungal infections, especially candidiasis, currently represent a significant problem for human health worldwide. Moreover, Candida albicans (C. albicans) is able to penetrate the stratum corneum inducing lesions, which often becomes systemic and occasionally lethal. Human cutaneous candidiasis is a pustular dermatosis characterized by visible and microscopic abscesses that are predominantly composed of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Usually, the effectiveness of a topical antifungal treatment depends on the ability of the drug to persist in the skin surface, penetrate through the stratum corneum, and through the C. albicans biofilm’s matrix to achieve the effective drug concentration levels inside the yeast’s cells. Different types of topical compounds have been used in the treatment of fungal skin infections. Among the main classes of antifungal drug, the azoles, which inhibit the fungal cytochrome P450, are the most successful in clinical use since the late 1960s. Clotrimazole (1-[(2-chlorophenyl)diphenylmethyl]-1H-imidazole), an imidazole derivative, is a widely used drug with a wide spectrum of antifungal activity, particularly against candidiasis. Clotrimazole is orally administered for the treatment of systemic candidiasis (pulmonary and disseminated cryptococcosis, and aspergillosis). However, because of its adverse effects following systemic administration, it is mainly used for the treatment of localized topical candidiasis. Further, its topical effectiveness seems to be strongly affected by the formulation, which may play a key role in ensuring the permanence and promoting the penetration of drugs in the skin and biofilm’s matrix. To reach this goal, during the past few decades, new topical delivery systems have been explored. Amongst them, phospholipid vesicles have evoked a considerable interest. Their effectiveness in skin delivery was reported for the first time by Mezei and Gulasekharam in 1980. In the last two decades, intensive research led to the introduction of new classes of liposome-like vesicles, capable of improving the performances of conventional liposomes, such as elastic or ultra-deformable liposomes so called Transfersomes®; soft vesicles containing ethanol (ethosomes); high performant vesicles containing penetration enhancers (penetration enhancers containing vesicles, PEVs); vesicles containing high amount of glycerol in the water phase (glycerosomes); and vesicles immobilized in a network of hyaluronan sodium salt (hyalurosomes). All these phospholipid vesicles are characterized by the presence of at least one additive component or a water cosolvent in the formulation and are mainly composed of phospholipids and not less than 50% of water as a hydrating medium.',\n",
       "  'To the best of our knowledge, in the present work, for the first time, new phospholipid vesicles were developed by significantly reducing the amount of water (≤10%) in the mixture used as a hydrating medium. Instead of water, a mixture of two co-solvents, glycerol and ethanol, was used. The assembling of phospholipid in a medium with a reduced amount of water was never studied before, and seems to be peculiar as the obtained dispersion appeared yellow-brown-transparent and highly viscous. Clotrimazole was stably loaded in high amounts into these hybrid vesicles and their main physico-chemical characteristics (size, size distribution, and surface charge) were measured. Morphology and structure were evaluated by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The topical delivery of clotrimazole containing hybrid vesicles was studied in vitro using Franz diffusion cells and newborn pig skin. The vesicle biocompatibility was assessed in vitro using keratinocytes. Further, the effectiveness of clotrimazole-loaded vesicles against different Candida strains was studied in vitro and in vivo against C. albicans infections on mice.',\n",

       "  'Aiming at improving the loading and stability of clotrimazole in phospholipid vesicles, a pre-formulation study was performed to find an adequate and promising preparation. Phospholipid vesicles were prepared using different kinds and amounts of phospholipids, and adding surfactants, co-solvents, or other additives. The obtained vesicles were unable to retain clotrimazole for more than one day as it precipitated in a short time irrespective of the composition and the size of the vesicles. For this reason, for the first time in this work, innovative formulations were developed, which involved reducing the amount of water usually used as typical hydrating medium of phospholipid vesicles, and mainly replacing it (≈90%) with a mixture of ethanol and glycerol, thus obtaining yellow-brown-transparent and viscous dispersions, which avoided the drug precipitation problem for a long time. Different ratios of glycerol, ethanol, and water were tested, and four mixtures were selected as they seemed to be the most promising in terms of size distribution and clotrimazole retention (Table 1). Corresponding empty vesicles were prepared to evaluate the influence of clotrimazole in vesicle assembling. ',\n",
       "  'Due to the novelty of these formulations, it is important that they were fully characterized. First, the formation and morphology of vesicles in their native environmental was observed using TEM (Figure 1, upper panel). The images confirmed the presence of coexisting multi- and single-lamellar vesicles, characterized by a fairly regular spherical shape, which appeared close-packed and formed a three-dimensional network. ',\n",
       "  'Further, to simulate the behavior that the vesicles may undergo in vivo in the biological fluids, the samples were diluted (1/500) with water, and in these conditions, it was possible to freeze the dispersion and observe them by using the cryo-TEM technique. After the dilution, the three-dimensionally-structured hybrid vesicles became single vesicles, and multi- and single-lamellar structures coexisted together (Figure 1, lower panel).',\n",
       "  'The size distribution, zeta potential, and entrapment efficiency of empty and clotrimazole-loaded hybrid vesicles were measured (Table 2). Empty vesicles were bigger than the corresponding clotrimazole-loaded vesicles denoting the influence of the drug in favoring the bilayer assembling, which resulted in a larger curvature and smaller vesicles. The amount of water was also able to modify the bilayer assembling, being bigger the vesicles containing the higher amount of water (53:10 vesicles and 63:10 vesicles, p < 0.05) with respect to the corresponding vesicles containing the lower amount (59:2 vesicles and 69:2 vesicles). Considering the clotrimazole loaded vesicles, the mixture glycerol/ethanol/water 59:39:2, containing the lower amount of water, provided the formation of the smallest vesicles (96 ± 2 nm), while increasing the amount of water (to glycerol/ethanol/water 53:37:10) provided a significant increase in vesicle mean diameter (186 ± 6 nm). The variation of glycerol and ethanol ratio, reducing the amount of ethanol in favor of that of glycerol (69:29:2 and 63:27:10 ratio), allowed for the formation of vesicles with an intermediate size (≈135 nm), irrespective of the amount of water used. The zeta potential was highly negative for all the formulations irrespective of the presence of the drug.',\n",
       "  'The amount of clotrimazole incorporated in both formulations containing the smaller amount of water (59:2 and 69:2 vesicles) was slightly higher (≈97%) in comparison with that incorporated in the formulations containing a higher amount of water (≈83%), probably because both glycerol and ethanol favored the solubilization of the drug inside the vesicles and in the vesicle bilayer.',\n",
       "  'Vesicle stability was evaluated for 90 days at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C, Figure 2). The values of the checked parameters (mean diameter, polydispersity index, and zeta potential) of 59:2 and 69:2 vesicles remained almost constant over all the storage periods (variation < 10%, p > 0.05), while 53:10 and 63:10 vesicles, containing a higher amount of water, suffered a significant change in size, as they reached ≈238 nm in diameter in a short time. The presence of water probably reduced the stability of the vesicles favoring its aggregation or fusion.',\n",

       "  'The 31P-NMR spectra of empty and clotrimazole-loaded three-dimensionally-structured hybrid vesicles were collected and compared (Figure 3).',\n",
       "  'The spectrum of the lecithin vesicles in water was used as a reference (Figure 3A). It showed isotropic components and a couple of narrow peaks were superimposed into a broader one, indicating the presence of vesicles of different sizes, although since the broadest one had a width at half height of about 2 ppm, it can be deduced that all these vesicles had sizes around 100 nm. A similar result was obtained for empty and clotrimazole-loaded 59:2 vesicles (Figure 3B,C). These results indicate that the presence of clotrimazole did not significantly alter either size or assembling of these vesicles. However, a different pattern was observed for empty 53:10 vesicles, in which a wider peak indicative of vesicles of higher diameter, possibly >200 nm, was observed in addition to the isotropic peaks (Figure 3D). This may indicate that the presence of a higher amount of water may determine the appearance of bigger vesicles, possibly due to fusion of the smaller ones. Clotrimazole-loaded 53:10 vesicles (Figure 3E), shown an isotropic pattern similar to those of Figure 3A, B, or C, indicates that the presence of clotrimazole modified the size distribution of the vesicles, making them smaller than the corresponding empty ones. However, the spectrum of empty 69:2 and 63:10 vesicles (Figure 3F,H) was similar to that of Figure 3D, with the presence of vesicles ≈200 nm together with isotropic ones, indicating that a higher percentage of glycerol and a lower amount of ethanol modified the bilayer assembling and vesicle diameter, in the same manner that the water allowed the formation of bigger vesicles. Similar spectra were observed for clotrimazole-loaded 69:2 and 63:10 vesicles (Figure 3G,I), which also indicate in this case, the presence of a heterogeneous population of vesicles. However, it should be stated that when 31P-NMR is used to calculate the size of lipid vesicles, it usually gives a lower diameter than those given using electron microscopy, which can be explained, at least in part, by ellipsoidal deformation during NMR measurements.',\n",
       "  'To further characterize the vesicle structure, small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS) were performed. Empty liposomes, and empty and clotrimazole-loaded three-dimensionally-structured hybrid vesicles, were analyzed and compared. WAXS diffractograms of all samples showed a very broad peak, thus indicating that all vesicles were in a fluid condition (data not shown). On the other hand, the SAXS diffraction pattern of all empty and clotrimazole-containing three-dimensionally-structured hybrid vesicles displayed a broad peak with pure diffuse scattering, indicative of unilamellar vesicles where the bilayers had no fixed geometrical relationship to each other (data not shown). The GAP model allowed us to calculate the fit dimensions of the polar head group and the thickness of the bilayer (Table 3). The mean distance of the polar head to the center of the bilayer (zH) was similar in all the samples (changes were always not higher than 2 Å). With respect to empty liposomes, a small decrease of 1.8 Å was observed for empty 59:2 vesicles (from 18.7 to 16.9 Å), and a 1.7 Å was detected for empty 53:10 vesicles (from 18.7 to 20.4 Å). In the case of the polar head amplitude (σH), the value of σH of pure phospholipid bilayer is usually around 3 Å and in agreement with that, a value of 3.4 ± 0.1 Å, was observed for empty liposomes. However, considerably higher values were found for empty (6.5 ± 0.1 Å) and clotrimazole-loaded 59:2 vesicles (6.3 ± 0.2 Å), and empty (6.7 ± 0.1 Å) and clotrimazole-loaded 63:10 vesicles (6.8 ± 0.2 Å), probably due to the high amount of glycerol and ethanol in the mixture. A substantially lower increase in σH was observed for empty (4.7 ± 0.2 Å) and clotrimazole-loaded 69:2 vesicles (4.5 ± 0.2 Å), and empty (4.8 ± 0.2 Å) and clotrimazole-loaded 63:10 vesicles (4.1 ± 0.2 Å). This different behavior may indicate that ethanol is the main substance responsible for the expansion of the polar group since 59:2 and 53:10 vesicles contained 39% and 36% of ethanol respectively, while 69:2 and 63:10 vesicles contained 29% and 27% of ethanol respectively. Results also indicate that glycerol simulated a behavior like that of water.',\n",
       "  'The bilayer thickness (dB) of empty liposomes was 51.0 ± 0.6 Å and those of three-dimensionally-structured hybrid vesicles were significantly higher (Table 3). This expansion of the bilayer thickness was a consequence of the presence of the glycerol and ethanol mixture, which played an important role on vesicle assembly. Indeed, the dB of clotrimazole-loaded 59:2 vesicles was 60.6 ± 1.2 Å and that of clotrimazole-loaded 53:10 vesicles was 62.0 ± 1.2 Å. Additionally, ethanol seemed to be the main substance responsible of this bilayer enlargement, and as already found for the increase of σH, for empty and clotrimazole-loaded 69:2 and 63:10 vesicles, the dB values were slightly smaller than that of 59:2 and 53:10 vesicles, which contained a higher amount of ethanol.',\n",

       "  'In vitro skin permeation studies displayed the ability of the three-dimensionally-structured hybrid vesicles to facilitate the accumulation of clotrimazole in the epidermis, especially in the stratum corneum (Figure 4). The amount of clotrimazole permeated through the skin into the receptor compartment was very low during the 8 h of experiment as it was not detectable using HPLC.',\n",
       "  'The commercial cream Canesten® was used as a reference. It is a commercial product containing clotrimazole (1%) dispersed in a cream composed of sorbitan monostearate, tween 60, cetile palmitate, cetostearyl alcohol, octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol, and water. Canesten® allowed for a very low accumulation of the drug in the different skin strata (≈2%, p < 0.05 versus that provided by all the other vesicles) to a significantly lesser extent with respect to three-dimensionally-structured hybrid vesicles. Indeed, when clotrimazole was loaded in hybrid vesicles, its accumulation in the stratum corneum (≈22%) was 7 times higher than that obtained using the commercial cream, while in the epidermis and dermis, it was 10 times higher (≈12%). No significant differences were found between the different hybrid vesicles, so we can hypothesize that all samples, thanks to the affinity of phospholipids toward the interlamellar matrix of stratum corneum, the moisturizing effect of glycerol and the solubilizing effect of ethanol, may reduce the skin barrier function, favoring the deposition of the drug in the different skin layers. On the contrary, the application of the commercial cream for 8 h was unable to effectively alter the assembling of the lipid matrix of the skin, thus the accumulation of clotrimazole in the different strata was significantly lower. Further, in the case of the commercial cream, the accumulation of the drug in the skin layers was limited by both the barrier effect of the stratum corneum and its partitioning between the stratum corneum and the vehicle (cream).

       "  'The toxicity of the different clotrimazole-loaded vesicles was evaluated using keratinocytes (HaCat) and measuring the cell viability using the MTT assay (Figure 5).',\n",
       "  'Topical formulations must necessarily make contact with the keratinocytes since they are the main cells of the epidermis and it is important that their topical application do not cause any adverse effect on these cells. For this reason, in vitro biocompatibility of formulations against keratinocytes was evaluated. At all tested clotrimazole concentrations (2, 10, 20, 50, 100 μg/mL), cell viability always ranged from ≈80 to ≈100%. This indicated that the variation of the vehicle used to obtain hybrid vesicles and the significant reduction of the amount of water did not modify the high and well-known biocompatibility of phospholipid vesicles.',\n",
       "  '3.5. In Vitro Antifungal Susceptibility Test ',\n",
       "  'The results obtained using the Kirby–Bauer procedure displayed a significant amount of activity from clotrimazole-loaded hybrid vesicles (≈46 cm) and a lower effectiveness provided by Canesten® (≈35 cm) (Figure 6), while empty vesicles did not exert any efficacy (data not shown).',\n",
       "  'The values of MIC, MBC, and antibiofilm profile were not evaluated for Canesten® cream since it formed a turbid dispersion, mainly due to the presence of different insoluble functional components, which interfered with the spectrophotometric measure. The quantitative antimicrobial determination of clotrimazole-loaded hybrid vesicles indicated a different efficacy as a function of the vesicle composition. Indeed, clotrimazole-loaded 63:10 vesicles had the lowest values of MIC and MBC (1.25 μg/mL), followed by clotrimazole-loaded 59:2 vesicles (2.50 μg/mL), while 53:10 and 69:2 vesicles and all empty vesicles were characterized by higher values (>5 μg/mL) (Table 4).',\n",
       "  'An antibiofilm assay showed a different and interesting behavior because clotrimazole-loaded 59:2 vesicles provided the highest biofilm inhibition (MBIC ≤ 0.002 μg/mL), followed by clotrimazole-loaded 63:10 vesicles (MBIC = 0.004 μg/mL). These values were much lower than that provided by clotrimazole loaded 53:10 vesicles and 69:2 vesicles (MBIC = 5 μg/mL). On the contrary, empty vesicles were not able to effectively inhibit both the biofilm and growth of C. albicans (MBIC > 5 μg/mL). Results confirmed the effectiveness of three-dimensionally-structured hybrid vesicles to promote the ability of clotrimazole to interfere with the formation of C. albicans biofilm. The outcomes confirmed a great potential of clotrimazole-loaded, three-dimensionally-structured hybrid vesicles, especially 59:2 and 63:10 vesicles, in inhibiting the C. albicans biofilm. In addition, results indicate an important role of glycerol in promoting the effectiveness of clotrimazole in both C. albicans growth and biofilm formation, as the best results were obtained using 63:10 and 59:2 vesicles containing the intermediate amount of glycerol (≈0.61 mL).',\n",
       "  '3.6. In Vivo Antifungal Activity Evaluation',\n",
       "  'The antifungal activity of clotrimazole-loaded hybrid vesicles was evaluated in vivo using mice carrying a dense layer of C. albicans on their dorsal skins. According to the guidelines of the ethical committee and aiming at reducing the number of used animals, only the two most promising formulations of clotrimazole-loaded, three-dimensionally-structured hybrid vesicles, which showed the best features on in vitro tests, were tested in vivo (59:2 and 63:10 vesicles). Saline was used in the control group (no inhibition of C. albicans growth) and Canesten® cream was employed as a reference treatment. Clotrimazole vesicles, as well as Canesten® cream, were able to reduce the count of the colonies of C. albicans (CFU) in comparison with the control group (Figure 7), but the reduction obtained using clotrimazole-loaded 59:2 and 63:10 vesicles was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that obtained with Canesten® cream. ',\n",
       "  'To further investigate the effective infection of the dorsal skin of mice after treatment with C. albicans, SEM studies were performed (Figure 8).',\n",
       "  'Infected skin showed a large number of yeasts (10–12 microns across) adhering to the skin (Figure 8A,B), which were not visible in the untreated skin (Figure 8C,D). The images confirmed the effective proliferation of C. albicans and the resulting infection on the skin.',\n",
       "  '4. Discussion',\n",
       "  'The skin is often subjected to different infections, with fungal ones being the most frequent. They first infect the skin surface and consequently invade the stratum corneum. Therapeutic agents can be applied to the surface of the skin in the form of creams, lotions, or sprays. They must be able to easily penetrate the stratum corneum and kill the fungi (fungicidal agents), or at least reduce their ability to grow or divide (fungistatic agents). Topical treatments represent the first choice to rid the skin of topical fungi and yeasts. Azoles (i.e., Miconazole, Clotrimazole, and Ketoconazole) are especially used for the treatment of infections caused by C. albicans; in particular, clotrimazole topical preparations are generally well-tolerated, even if local irritation has necessitated the withdrawal of therapy in a few cases. Different studies were carried out, aiming at ameliorating the antifungal efficacy of clotrimazole after topical application. Soriano et al. formulated a nanoemulsion of clotrimazole designed as topical and mucosal delivery systems. Despite their good properties in terms of physico-chemical characteristics and stability behavior, these systems were not able to ameliorate the permeation parameters, nor the skin-retained amount, but were able to improve the antifungal activity in comparison with the commercial cream used as reference.',\n",
       "  'Hashem et al. formulated microemulsions, which showed, when incorporated in a conventional gel, an improvement (2 or 3 times) of the clotrimazole retention in the skin, as well as of the antifungal activity, in comparison with commercial cream, probably due to the adhesive properties of the gel containing the microemulsion.',\n",
       "  'Akhtar et al. demonstrated the ability of ethosomes modified using Cavamax W7 and penetration enhancers (PEG 400, isopropylmyristate, or triethanolamine), to improve the permeation and accumulation of clotrimazole into the skin. The antifungal activity against C. Albicans was improved as well using the ethosomal formulation. However, to ensure the correct application of the formulation in the skin, these systems were inserted in a conventional gel of Carbopol.',\n",
       "  'The insertion of a nanocarier into a structured vehicle, such as cream, ointment, or gel, to ensure the correct application of the drug in the skin, is a widely used approach. However, it must be taken into account that the diffusion and accumulation of the drug into the skin may be limited by its partitioning between the structured vehicle and the stratum corneum, reducing its effectiveness against topical infections.',\n",
       "  'To further ameliorate the efficacy of the treatment of the skin infections caused by Candida albicans, and to avoid the addition of structured vehicles, in this study, for the first time, new phospholipid vesicles were formulated by using a mixture of glycerol-ethanol with a low water content (≤10%) as a hydrating medium, leading to the formation of three-dimensionally-structured hybrid and highly viscous vesicles. Additionally, hybrid vesicles were prepared using an environmentally-friendly, easily reproducible, and organic solvent-free method. The performed dynamic laser light scattering, 31P-NMR, and SAXS measurements confirmed the formation of lamellar vesicles that were small in size, where the clotrimazole played a key role in their assembling and features, probably because it was well-solubilized in both vesicle compartments, i.e., the hydrating medium and phospholipid bilayer. The combination of TEM and cryo-TEM analysis allowed us to discover the native structure of dispersions in a three-dimensionally-structured network, which conferred high viscosity and stability to the system. After dilution in water media simulating the behavior in biological fluids, the network disappeared, and vesicles became akin to single particles in dispersion without undergoing the phenomena of breaking or destabilization. We can speculate that their peculiar behavior can facilitate topical delivery of the payload because the dispersion can be easily applied on the skin, avoiding the loss of the formulation after application thanks to its highly viscous structured framework. On the skin’s surface, the dispersion may interact with the components of the stratum corneum and then with biological fluids undergoing a dilution, which favors the penetration of single vesicles into both the stratum corneum and biofilm matrix. Moreover, a part of vesicles can fuse within the skin matrix, modifying its lamellar assembling and perturbing its ordered structure due to the combined action of phospholipids, glycerol, and ethanol. As confirmation of this mechanism, all hybrid vesicles, irrespective to the hydrating medium composition, were able to improve the skin accumulation of clotrimazole to a greater extent than the commercial cream Canesten® used as a reference. In addition, despite the high amount of ethanol and glycerol used as a hydrating medium, the biocompatibility was very high (≈90% viability), confirming that the new vehicle used to produce hybrid vesicles did not modify the low toxicity of phospholipid vesicles. Physico-chemical and technological properties of hybrid vesicles did not display important differences among the different formulations, irrespective of the hydrating mixture used. ',\n",
       "  'In contrast, antimicrobial results confirmed the promising properties of all these new hybrid vesicles as carriers for the treatment of local C. albicans infections, but in particular, showed the specific activity of 59:2 and 63:10 vesicle formulations against Candida biofilm. These hybrid vesicles contained an intermediate amount of glycerol (≈0.61 mL) and this concentration seemed to be ideal in modulating the vesicles’ ability to interfere against biofilm formation at a low concentration. It is well known that skin candidiasis represents a “biofilm-related disease” and many studies confirmed the poor ability of azoles to counteract C. albicans infections structured as a biofilm. In this study, clotrimazole loaded in 59:2 and 63:10 vesicles showed a great ability to counteract C. albicans infections and inhibit the biofilm formation, thus underlining their promising properties, especially taking into consideration the increasing resistance of this yeast to traditional antifungal formulations and treatments. ',\n",
       "  'The in vitro results were confirmed by those obtained in vivo, which underlined the higher effectiveness of the selected formulations to reduce the number of the colonies of the yeasts (CFU) in comparison with the commercial cream Canesten® used as a reference. ',\n",
       "  '5. Conclusions',\n",
       "  'Overall, results of this study support the design of a new and promising kind of phospholipid vesicles called three-dimensionally-structured hybrid vesicles due to their original structure in dispersion, obtained by using a mixture of glycerol and ethanol with a low content of water (≤10%) as a hydrating medium. These hybrid vesicles were prepared by using an environmentally-friendly method, avoiding the use of organic solvents or dissipative methodologies. Four different formulations were obtained by changing the ratio between ethanol, glycerol, and water, which were all highly stable and able to promote the payload accumulation in the different skin strata and its antifungal activity. Results underlined that 59:2 and 63:10 hybrid vesicles contained the ideal combination of ethanol and glycerol that was capable of ensuring the highest protection against C. albicans biofilm formation and infection resistance. In conclusion, these hybrid vesicles may be considered as promising carriers for the treatment of topical fungal infections. ',\n",
